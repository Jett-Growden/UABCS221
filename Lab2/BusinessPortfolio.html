<h2>About me</h2>
<section><p>
    I am in my second year of studying computer science and in my 3rd year at university,
    I am from Daphne, Alabama and graduated from Daphne High School.
    I have completed two internships in my time as a student, one at Austal USA in Mobile, Alabama
    my time there was spent during Winter Break 2022, and I was interning under IT Support Desk,
    Controls Engineers, and IT Security Department. My second one was at General Dynamics Missions Systems,
    I was there for 3 months over Summer 2023 with the Infrastructure Surface Ship Software Team. I am currently
    working as a Teachers Aid for CS203 Object-Oriented Programming at UAB in Fall 2023.

    I do not currently have any personal projects that I have worked on outside of school
    due to my previous internship taking most of my time. However, I will link my GitHub repository
    where I plan to place future projects <a href="https://github.com/Jett-Growden/Projects.git">here</a>.
